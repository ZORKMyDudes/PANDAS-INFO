<h2>I LOVE PANDAS AND THEY ARE AMAZING</h2>

<p class = blueparagraph>Pandas are cute and they know life skills. They sleep and eat then play. Some people call them useless or lazy and honestly they are lazy and that is not bad. But they are not useless. If pandas were extinct then the bamboo would keep growing uncontrolably. Bamboo spreads extremely quick. If you get the right picture they can be the most cute animal ever. They are endangered and some people are trying to protect the pandas. They are also brought into a zoos. China has the most pandas in he world.  </p>
